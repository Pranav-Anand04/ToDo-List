#### Description:

This is a Todo List website made out of javascript, html and css, This project helps you organize todos you have to do througout the day. At first I created a popup, at which if you submit the form empty then it will display error popup. The I created a task form and horray popup screen. With that hooray popup screen there is a ok button. The horray popup Screen contains smile.jpeg. In the script tag I first declared the variables that I know will go in the code. Then If I didnt declare one I added them later. Then I made a submit function that contians if it reload don't do the default and has a function addingtask() and local storage which all stuff will be save there. Then I created a function of the dark mode icon so if the user clicks it the background will change color by a conditional if else if statement. Next comes up adding task where if user has no task then it will remove hidden popup. Then I start creating the divs of task and adding classlist and inputs. I continue adding buttons and giving it a task and appending the child so it shows in screen. after that in that function there is popup function, edit, delete and complete. Then I push the todo. This all will trigger when form function button is sumbimited.
